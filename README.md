## What is Computer Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer ‚Äî things you can see and touch like CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, ports, etc.

## Motherboard ‚Äì

Central Hub of the System

The motherboard is the main printed circuit board that connects all parts of a computer.

## Basic Structure of a Motherboard

The motherboard is a flatboard made of printed circuits. It has many small parts on it. These parts include slots, sockets, and connectors. Each section of the motherboard has a specific role. For example:

^ The CPU socket holds the central processing unit (CPU).

^ RAM slots are used for memory modules.

^ Other connectors help attach storage devices and graphics cards.

### Function of Motherboard

The primary function of a motherboard is to provide a central platform where different components like the processor (CPU), memory modules (RAM), storage drives (HDD/SSD), and expansion cards can be integrated and work together seamlessly. It manages the data, instructions, and power flow between these connected devices.

In simpler terms, you can think of a motherboard as the command centre that allows the different parts of a computer to talk to each other and function as a complete system. It houses vital components like the CPU socket (where the processor is installed), memory slots (for RAM modules), and various ports/interfaces to connect peripherals. The motherboard also distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU) to all the connected components.

## Memory Hierarchy

|Memory      | Speed   | Size   | Use|
|------------|---------|--------|-----|
|Registers	 |Fastest  |Smallest|	CPU instruction handling|
|Cache Memory|Very Fast|Small	  |Frequently used data for CPU|
|RAM	       |Fast	   |Medium	|Temporary working memory|
|Hard Disk	 |Slow    |Large	  |Permanent storage|

# Power Supply (SMPS)

^ Converts AC ‚Üî DC (Switch Mode Power Supply)

^ Provides power to all components

^ Works with CMOS Battery to:

‚Ä¢ Keep BIOS settings

‚Ä¢ Maintain system clock even when PC is off

##  Booting Process (Power ON to OS)
- Power goes to ROM
- Bootstrap loader is activated
- OS is copied from Hard Disk ‚Üí RAM
- CPU starts processing via registers and cache
‚úÖ This startup process is called Booting

####  What Happens When You Power On Your PC (Hardware Level)

^ Power supply starts

‚Ä¢ Sends power to all components.

^ CPU wakes up

‚Ä¢ Looks for instructions from BIOS/UEFI.

^ BIOS/UEFI runs

‚Ä¢ Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) to check hardware.

^ Boot device is found

‚Ä¢Searches for a bootable device like SSD/HDD.

^ Bootloader is loaded

‚Ä¢ Loads a small program into RAM.

^ Operating system starts loading 

‚Ä¢ The OS kernel takes control and the system starts.

 ## Cache Memory
 
^ Between CPU and RAM
^ Holds frequently accessed data
^ Reduces speed mismatch
^ Saves CPU time by fetching data faster than RAM
‚úÖ Cache memory is faster than RAM ‚úÖ Most required data is kept in cache

### Why Do We Need Cache Memory?
^ Cache memory reduces the speed gap between the fast CPU and slower main memory (RAM).

^ It stores frequently accessed data and instructions for quicker access.

^ It minimizes the time the CPU spends waiting for data, improving efficiency.

^ It increases overall system performance by reducing memory access delays.

^ It decreases the load on main memory by handling repeated data access.

^ It speeds up the execution of loops and functions by keeping them readily available.

### RAM Types
|Type|	Full Form	Feature|
|----|--------------------|
|SRAM|	Static RAM	No refresh, fast, costly|
|DRAM| Dynamic RAM	Needs refresh, slower, widely used|

### Storage Devices

Device	Use
Hard Disk	Main permanent storage
SSD	Faster version of HDD (Solid State)
DVD Drive	Optical disk reading
Blu-ray Disc	New version of DVD (double layer)
Floppy Disk	Very old data storage
Pen Drive	Portable data transfer
üåê 9. Input/Output Ports & Interfaces
Port/Device	Purpose
HDMI Port	High-quality video/audio output
VGA Port	Old analog display (needs converter)
LAN Adapter	Connects to local network
NIC	Enables networking/internet
USB Ports	Connects pen drives, keyboard, mouse etc.
Data Cables	Usually copper wires used for transfer
üîß 10. BIOS, Firmware, and Drivers
Term	Explanation
BIOS/UEFI	Firmware stored in ROM; runs before OS starts
Drivers	Utility software that enables hardware working
üîå 11. Extra Hardware Concepts
Concept	Description
Modem	Converts analog ‚Üî digital signals
UPS	Backup power source (uses battery)
SMPS	Converts voltage (AC ‚Üî DC)
Bootstrap	Startup instructions in ROM to load OS
Registers	Tiny memory in CPU; faster than RAM, used for execution
üß† 12. Chipset & Bridges (Detailed)
Bridge	Function
Northbridge	Connects CPU to RAM, GPU, cache
Southbridge	Connects CPU to I/O devices like USB, HDD, network
üß© These two bridges together form the motherboard chipset ‚Äì managing data flow inside the system.
