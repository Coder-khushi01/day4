## What is Computer Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer — things you can see and touch like CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, ports, etc.

## Motherboard –

Central Hub of the System

The motherboard is the main printed circuit board that connects all parts of a computer.

## Basic Structure of a Motherboard

The motherboard is a flatboard made of printed circuits. It has many small parts on it. These parts include slots, sockets, and connectors. Each section of the motherboard has a specific role. For example:

^ The CPU socket holds the central processing unit (CPU).

^ RAM slots are used for memory modules.

^ Other connectors help attach storage devices and graphics cards.

### Function of Motherboard

The primary function of a motherboard is to provide a central platform where different components like the processor (CPU), memory modules (RAM), storage drives (HDD/SSD), and expansion cards can be integrated and work together seamlessly. It manages the data, instructions, and power flow between these connected devices.

In simpler terms, you can think of a motherboard as the command centre that allows the different parts of a computer to talk to each other and function as a complete system. It houses vital components like the CPU socket (where the processor is installed), memory slots (for RAM modules), and various ports/interfaces to connect peripherals. The motherboard also distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU) to all the connected components.

## Memory Hierarchy

|Memory      | Speed   | Size   | Use|
|------------|---------|--------|-----|
|Registers	 |Fastest  |Smallest|	CPU instruction handling|
|Cache Memory|Very Fast|Small	  |Frequently used data for CPU|
|RAM	       |Fast	   |Medium	|Temporary working memory|
|Hard Disk	 |Slow    |Large	  |Permanent storage|

# Power Supply (SMPS)

^ Converts AC ↔ DC (Switch Mode Power Supply)

^ Provides power to all components

^ Works with CMOS Battery to:

• Keep BIOS settings

• Maintain system clock even when PC is off

##  Booting Process (Power ON to OS)
- Power goes to ROM
- Bootstrap loader is activated
- OS is copied from Hard Disk → RAM
- CPU starts processing via registers and cache
✅ This startup process is called Booting

####  What Happens When You Power On Your PC (Hardware Level)

^ Power supply starts

• Sends power to all components.

^ CPU wakes up

• Looks for instructions from BIOS/UEFI.

^ BIOS/UEFI runs

• Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) to check hardware.

^ Boot device is found

•Searches for a bootable device like SSD/HDD.

^ Bootloader is loaded

• Loads a small program into RAM.

^ Operating system starts loading 

• The OS kernel takes control and the system starts.

 ## Cache Memory
 
^ Between CPU and RAM
^ Holds frequently accessed data
^ Reduces speed mismatch
^ Saves CPU time by fetching data faster than RAM
✅ Cache memory is faster than RAM ✅ Most required data is kept in cache

### Why Do We Need Cache Memory?
^ Cache memory reduces the speed gap between the fast CPU and slower main memory (RAM).

^ It stores frequently accessed data and instructions for quicker access.

^ It minimizes the time the CPU spends waiting for data, improving efficiency.

^ It increases overall system performance by reducing memory access delays.

^ It decreases the load on main memory by handling repeated data access.

^ It speeds up the execution of loops and functions by keeping them readily available.

### RAM Types
|Type|	Full Form	Feature|
|----|--------------------|
|SRAM|	Static RAM	No refresh, fast, costly|
|DRAM| Dynamic RAM	Needs refresh, slower, widely used|

## Storage Devices

|Device|	Use|
|------|----|
| Hard Disk|	Main permanent storage|
|SSD|	Faster version of HDD (Solid State)|
|DVD Drive|	Optical disk reading|
|Blu-ray |Disc	New version of DVD (double layer)|
|Floppy Disk|	Very old data storage|
|Pen Drive	|Portable data transfer|

## Input/Output Ports & Interfaces

|Port/Device	|Purpose|
|------------|-------|
|HDMI Port|	High-quality video/audio output|
|VGA Port|	Old analog display (needs converter)|
|LAN Adapter|	Connects to local network|
|NIC|	Enables networking/internet|
|USB Ports	|Connects pen drives, keyboard, mouse etc.|
|Data Cables|	Usually copper wires used for transfer|

## BIOS, Firmware, and Drivers

|Term|	Explanation|
|-----|-----------|
|BIOS/UEFI|	Firmware stored in ROM; runs before OS starts|
|Drivers|	Utility software that enables hardware working|

## Extra Hardware Concepts

|Concept|	Description|
|-------|------------|
|Modem|	Converts analog ↔ digital signals|
|UPS|	Backup power source (uses battery)|
|SMPS	|Converts voltage (AC ↔ DC)|
|Bootstrap|	Startup instructions in ROM to load OS|
|Registers|	Tiny memory in CPU; faster than RAM, used for execution|

##  Chipset & Bridges (Detailed)

|Bridge|	Function|
|-------|--------|
|Northbridge|	Connects CPU to RAM, GPU, cache|
|Southbridge|	Connects CPU to I/O devices like USB, HDD, network|

 These two bridges together form the motherboard chipset – managing data flow inside the system.
