## What is Computer Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer — things you can see and touch like CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, ports, etc.

## Motherboard –

Central Hub of the System

The motherboard is the main printed circuit board that connects all parts of a computer.

## Basic Structure of a Motherboard

The motherboard is a flatboard made of printed circuits. It has many small parts on it. These parts include slots, sockets, and connectors. Each section of the motherboard has a specific role. For example:

^ The CPU socket holds the central processing unit (CPU).

^ RAM slots are used for memory modules.

^ Other connectors help attach storage devices and graphics cards.

### Function of Motherboard

The primary function of a motherboard is to provide a central platform where different components like the processor (CPU), memory modules (RAM), storage drives (HDD/SSD), and expansion cards can be integrated and work together seamlessly. It manages the data, instructions, and power flow between these connected devices.

In simpler terms, you can think of a motherboard as the command centre that allows the different parts of a computer to talk to each other and function as a complete system. It houses vital components like the CPU socket (where the processor is installed), memory slots (for RAM modules), and various ports/interfaces to connect peripherals. The motherboard also distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU) to all the connected components.

## Memory Hierarchy

|Memory      | Speed   | Size   | Use|
|Registers	 |Fastest  |Smallest|	CPU instruction handling|
|Cache Memory|Very Fast|Small	  |Frequently used data for CPU|
|RAM	       |Fast	   |Medium	|Temporary working memory|
|Hard Disk	 |Slow|    |Large	  |Permanent storage|
